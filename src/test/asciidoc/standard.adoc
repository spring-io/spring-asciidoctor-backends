This is an example asciidoctor file that doesn't use any special extensions and should render well on any backend.

== Text



=== Paragraph
A paragraph is just some text.
Paragraphs can have more than one line in them.

Leave a gap to start a new paragraph.
It's best to have one sentence per line in your source, it will still be wrapped when converted.



=== Literal Paragraph
 A literal paragraph is just some text.
 Unlike a regular paragraph it has a space before it.

 Text is rendered in a monospace font



=== Formatted text
*bold* & **bold**er**dash**

_italic_ & __ital__ice__maker__

*_bold italic_* & **__bold__**er**__dash__**

`monospace words` & ``mono``space``ship``

`*monospace bold words*` & ``**mono**``space``**ship**``

`_monospace italic words_` & ``__mono__``space``__ship__``

`*_monospace bold italic words_*` &
``**__mono__**``space``**__ship__**``

Use a highlighter pen to #highlight#.

Use a ##highlight##er pen to highlight.

Use a [.line-through]#underliner# pen to underline.

We need [.line-through]#striker# pen to strike out.

We can do ^super^script.

We can do ~sub~script.

We "`can`" also '`do`' smart things with quotes.



=== Admonitions
You can use note, tip, important, warning and caution to bring attention to something:

NOTE: Don't eat yellow snow.

TIP: Don't eat yellow snow.

IMPORTANT: Don't eat yellow snow.

WARNING: Don't eat yellow snow.

CAUTION: Don't eat yellow snow.

NOTE: You can also have more than one sentence.
They all appear in the admon box.

[TIP]
====
You can also have complex paragraphs.
With things that include `formatted` text.

[source,java]
----
System.out.println("And even code");
----
====



=== Headings
Headings have different levels.



==== Deeper
They can go down.



===== Underground
And down.



====== This is Your Stop
And so on.

https://spring.io[Go to spring.io] to learn about Spring.

https://github.com/asciidoctor[Asciidoctor is great!]

Of course, you can also have https://spring.io[`monospaced links`].

=== Q&A
[qanda]
Ask on one line?:: For sure
You can ask a question?::
  And provide a nice answer.
  That's a bit more involved.

== Source code
You can use `backticks` to make a bit of text monospaced.

Source blocks are very nice and they work with callouts:

[source,xml]
----
<section>
  <title>Section Title</title> <!--1-->
</section>
----
<1> The section title is required.


Here's some java with callouts:

[source,java,indent=0]
----
	@Component
	public class ReadinessStateExporter {

		@EventListener
		public void onStateChange(AvailabilityChangeEvent<ReadinessState> event) {
			switch (event.getState()) {
			case ACCEPTING_TRAFFIC: // <1>
				// create file /tmp/healthy
			break;
			case REFUSING_TRAFFIC: // <2>
				// remove file /tmp/healthy
			break;
			}
		}

	}

<1> A sample comment.
<2> A multiline comment with a lot of text. The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog.
The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog.


Why not have some YAML:

[source,yaml,indent=0]
----
	spring:
	  application:
	    name: "myapp"
	  config:
	    import: "optional:file:./dev.properties"
----

Or JSON:

[source,json,indent=0]
----
{
   "glossary" : {
      "title" : "example glossary",
      "GlossDiv" : {
         "title" : "S",
         "GlossList" : {
            "GlossEntry" : {
               "ID" : "SGML",
               "SortAs" : "SGML",
               "GlossTerm" : "Standard Generalized Markup Language",
               "Acronym" : "SGML",
               "Thing" : true,
               "Size" : 12,
               "Abbrev" : "ISO 8879:1986",
               "GlossDef" : {
                  "para" : "A meta-markup language, used to create markup languages such as DocBook.",
                  "GlossSeeAlso" : [
                     "GML",
                     "XML"
                  ]
               },
               "GlossSee" : "markup"
            }
         }
      }
   }
}

Or some HTTP that also has `nowrap` set:

[source,http,options="nowrap"]
----
HTTP/1.1 200 OK
Content-Type: application/vnd.spring-boot.actuator.v3+json
Content-Length: 121
{
  "events" : [ {
    "timestamp" : "2021-03-18T16:49:30.625Z",
    "principal" : "alice",
    "type" : "logout"
  } ]
}

== Blockquotes

I could be wrong, but, I doubt it.

== Edge cases
There are a few things that can trip our stylesheet up if we're not careful:



=== Long Tables
A table with long entries and no breakable space.

[cols="1,2", options="header"]
.Issues
|===
|Name
|Description

|VeryLongNameWithoutBreakableSpaceVeryLongNameWithoutBreakableSpaceVeryLongNameWithoutBreakableSpaceVeryLongNameWithoutBreakableSpace
|This is an edge case

|Name
|Another entry
|===

That's the end of that.



=== Another Long Table


When a Spring Boot application starts:

[cols="2,2,2,3,5"]
|===
|Startup phase |LivenessState |ReadinessState |HTTP server |Notes

|Starting
|`BROKEN`
|`REFUSING_TRAFFIC`
|Not started
|Kubernetes checks the "liveness" Probe and restarts the application if it takes too long.

|Started
|`CORRECT`
|`REFUSING_TRAFFIC`
|Refuses requests
|The application context is refreshed. The application performs startup tasks and does not receive traffic yet.

|Ready
|`CORRECT`
|`ACCEPTING_TRAFFIC`
|Accepts requests
|Startup tasks are finished. The application is receiving traffic.
|===

When a Spring Boot application shuts down:

[cols="2,2,2,3,5"]
|===
|Shutdown phase |Liveness State |Readiness State |HTTP server |Notes

|Running
|`CORRECT`
|`ACCEPTING_TRAFFIC`
|Accepts requests
|Shutdown has been requested.

|Graceful shutdown
|`CORRECT`
|`REFUSING_TRAFFIC`
|New requests are rejected
|If enabled, <<spring-boot-features#boot-features-graceful-shutdown,graceful shutdown processes in-flight requests>>.

|Shutdown complete
|N/A
|N/A
|Server is shut down
|The application context is closed and the application is shut down.
|===

TIP: Check out the Kubernetes container lifecycle section for more information about Kubernetes deployment.



=== Long Shell Blocks
A shell code block can also break things:

[indent=0,subs="attributes"]
